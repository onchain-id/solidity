    *  claim: A claim published for the Identity.
    *  topic: A uint256 number which represents the topic of the claim. (e.g. 1 biometric, 2 residence (ToBeDefined:
    *  number schemes, sub topics based on number ranges??))
    *  scheme : The scheme with which this claim SHOULD be verified or how it should be processed. Its a uint256 for
    *  different schemes. E.g. could 3 mean contract verification, where the data will be call data, and the issuer a
    *  contract address to call (ToBeDefined). Those can also mean different key types e.g. 1 = ECDSA, 2 = RSA, etc.
    *  (ToBeDefined)
    *  issuer: The issuers identity contract address, or the address used to sign the above signature. If an
    *  identity contract, it should hold the key with which the above message was signed, if the key is not present
    *  anymore, the claim SHOULD be treated as invalid. The issuer can also be a contract address itself, at which the
    *  claim can be verified using the call data.
    *  signature: Signature which is the proof that the claim issuer issued a claim of topic for this identity. it
    *  MUST be a signed message of the following structure: `keccak256(abi.encode(identityHolder_address, topic, data))`
    *  data: The hash of the claim data, sitting in another location, a bit-mask, call data, or actual data based on
    *  the claim scheme.
    *  uri: The location of the claim, this can be HTTP links, swarm hashes, IPFS hashes, and such.
