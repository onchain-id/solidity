### Breaking changes

## Deprecation Notice
- ClaimIssuer `revokeClaim` is now deprecated, usage of `revokeClaimBySignature(bytes signature)` is preferred.

### Added
- Add typechain-types (targeting ethers v5).
- Add tests cases for `execute` and `approve` methods.
- Add method `revokeClaimBySignature(bytes signature)` in ClaimIssuer, prefer using this method instead of the now
deprecated `revokeClaim` method.
- Add checks on ClaimIssuer to prevent revoking an already revoked claim.
- Added Factory for ONCHAINIDs

### Updated
- Switch development tooling to hardhat.
- Implemented tests for hardhat (using fixture for faster testing time).
- Prevent calling `approve` method with a non-request execute nonce (added a require on `executionNone`).
- Update NatSpec of `execute` and `approve` methods.
