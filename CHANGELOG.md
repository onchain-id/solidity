# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.3.0]

### Changed
- Changed solidity compiler version to v0.8.24. Newer version of the compiler implements several gas and security related improvements. also compatible with latest version of @openzeppelin/contracts.
- Changed hardhat version to 2.21.0. This version of hardhat comes with ethers v6 which implements modern ES6 features, like ES2020 BigInt.

## [2.2.1]

### Changed
- Replaced the storage slot used for ImplementationAuthority on the proxies, to avoid conflict with ERC-1822 on
  block explorers. By using the same storage slot, the explorers were identifying this proxy as an ERC-1822, while
  it's a different implementation here, the storage slot is not used to store the address of the implementation but
  the address to ImplementationAuthority contract that references the implementation

## [2.2.0]

### Added
- Identities are now required to implement the standardized `function isClaimValid(IIdentity _identity, uint256
claimTopic, bytes calldata sig, bytes calldata data) external view returns (bool)`, used for self-attested claims
(`_identity` is the address of the Identity contract).
- Implemented the `isClaimValid` function in the `Identity` contract.
- IdFactory now implements the `implementationAuthority()` getter.

## [2.1.0]

### Added
- Implemented a new contract `Gateway` to interact with the `IdFactory`. The `Gateway` contract allows individual
accounts (being EOA or contracts) to deploy identities for their own address as a salt. To deploy using
a custom salt, a signature from an approved signer is required.
- Implemented a new base contract `Verifier` to be extended by contract requiring identity verification based on claims
and trusted issuers.

## [2.0.1]

### Added
- added method createIdentityWithManagementKeys() that allows the factory to issue identities with multiple
  management keys.
- tests for the createIdentityWithManagementKeys() method

## [2.0.0]

Version 2.0.0 Audited by Hacken, more details [here](https://tokeny.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Tokeny_ONCHAINID_SC-Audit_Report.pdf)

### Breaking changes

## Deprecation Notice
- ClaimIssuer `revokeClaim` is now deprecated, usage of `revokeClaimBySignature(bytes signature)` is preferred.

### Added
- Add typechain-types (targeting ethers v5).
- Add tests cases for `execute` and `approve` methods.
- Add method `revokeClaimBySignature(bytes signature)` in ClaimIssuer, prefer using this method instead of the now
deprecated `revokeClaim` method.
- Add checks on ClaimIssuer to prevent revoking an already revoked claim.
- Added Factory for ONCHAINIDs

### Updated
- Switch development tooling to hardhat.
- Implemented tests for hardhat (using fixture for faster testing time).
- Prevent calling `approve` method with a non-request execute nonce (added a require on `executionNone`).
- Update NatSpec of `execute` and `approve` methods.
